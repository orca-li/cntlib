  <h1>cntlib | about</h1>
  <h2>STYLE</h2>
  <p>
    I developed this programming style for writing large amounts of code solo. This was driven by three problems:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I write code and work alone</li>
    <li>I don't have a modular and flexible architecture</li>
    <li>It's hard to come up with algorithms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All three of these problems are solved by doing the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't write code alone</li>
    <li>Study other people's programming styles</li>
    <li>Learn existing algorithms and don't reinvent the wheel</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But all three of these solutions don't work for me for one reason. I don't want to spend my time. I want to manage
    processes, not be immersed in them. It's very difficult to find like-minded people you can lead, and I want to
    oversee
    everything. So, you have a problem. You're alone. Don't despair, use this problem as an advantage. If you're alone,
    it probably means nobody needs your code. This means that nobody will check your code's performance. It means that
    nobody needs your algorithms. Therefore, there's no point in spending time on good algorithms. Your goal is to write
    algorithms as quickly as possible, even if they're stupid.

  <p>My next goal in programming is mastering code and project architecture. I aspire to design high-level architectural
    solutions. I find it difficult to independently conceive of architecture for extended periods. Essentially, when
    creating
    something for the first time - a driver, for instance spending excessive time on architecture is unproductive.
    You'll
    inevitably rewrite in numerous times. Furthermore, in an OOP paradigm, determining which objects to create and where
    to
    begin is significant challenge. Essentially, <code>cntlib</code> could serve as a core component for any object, If
    you're
    working with enumerations, numbers, items, coordinates, etc., <code>cntlib</code> provides a solid foundation for
    the objects
    you'll need to develop. My approach isn't to design an architecture and then force the code to conform; rather, I
    aim to
    write code that organically shapes the architecture. Perhaps I've finally arrived at a true understanding of OOP.

  <h2>POINTER OR COUNTER?</h2>
  <p>
    You're basically living and breathing pointers when you're coding in C. I remeber that time I tried to make the
    <code>%b</code> specifier
    work for my <code>printf()</code>. It took me a week, and I still didn't get it right because I ran out time and had
    a mountain
    of bugs. You'd think printing bits would be simple, right? But oh no, I had to make my own protocol. It ended up
    with a thousand
    lines of code, tons of bugs, and unreadable algorithms that I didn't even want to look at. I was parsing text and
    writing all kinds
    of complicated things, but it would be way too much for a beginner.<br><br>

    The last straw was trying to write a FAT32 file system driver. Instead of text, I was dealing with all kinds of byte
    fields. It
    was pointer madness all over again. I'd go to an address, reset it, or not. Sometimes I needed to save, sometimes
    not. What's the
    best way to read and process bytes? Do you pass a number or a pointer? Where do you put this stuff? And what do you
    call it? And
    don't even get me started on encapsulation. The whole thing turned into a coding disaster, and I lost all motivation
    to keep
    working on it.<br><br>

    Pointers, pointers, pointers, everywhere. So many pointers! Will it ever stop? Finally, OOP comes to the rescue! But
    methods? Those
    are just pointers to functions. Although, we call those interfaces in C. There are just so many different types of
    pointers, and their
    meaning keeps changing. And those algorithms change with the types, yet we call them all pointers.<br><br>

    When learning C, eventually you're going to have to deal with linker scripts and this "location counter" idea. It's
    basically "just add one".
    And you can choose where you're starting from. This is how I got the first idea for the object in my library.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
typedef struct LOCATION_COUNTER_TYPE
{
  size_t c;
  char* p;
} loccnt_t;
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Obviously, this approach will die at the encapsulation stage. When a location counter is nested inside other
    location counters, like a
    matryoshka doll. Moreover, their steps may differ. Therefore, you will come to this system.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
typedef struct LOCACTION_COUNTER_TYPE
{
  unsigned char stepsz;
  size_t c;
  char* p;
} loccnt_t;
</code></pre>
  <p>
    But even that won't help you, because you'll end up with such ugly code:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
void foo(char* buffer)
{
  clustercnt clscnt = {
    .stepsz = sizeof(sectorcnt),
    .c = 0,
    .p = buffer,
    .sectorcnt = {
      .stepsz = SECTORSIZE,
      .c = 0,
      .p = buffer,
      .loccnt = {
        .stepsz = 1,
        .c = 0,
        .p = buffer
      }
    }
  };
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    And that's just the beginning of your problems! Just think about all the functions(methods) you'll still have to
    write. I won't event list the number of terrible problems that await you. Furthermore, all these pointers are
    closely related,
    and you'll have to combine this monstrosity, with different region sizes, and sometimes you'll need to write to
    two tables simultaneously!!! What are you going to do with this Tower of Babel?
  </p>
  <h2>TOWERS FALL</h2>
  <p>
    You work and write code alone. You have little time because developing in C requires vast knowledge, a lot of code,
    and a lon learning period. Algorithms and code architecture shouldn't concern you; otherwise, you won't get anything
    done. I said at the beginning of this chapter, leave the algorithms to other programmers. Perhaps you'll just
    abandon
    the project because you'll realize that nobody needs it. Your code is not needed by anyone - this is the most common
    ending for a lot of code. And writing code is a huge waste of time. I often abandoned my projects because I
    understood
    that nobody needed them. And that was the right thing to do. Especially for young programmers, the growth of your
    knowledge
    will often change the course of your ship. This is called intellect and development. Changing direction is often
    right
    and necessary. If you've changed course, it means you've realized that you were striving for an unnecessary goal.
    You need
    to change the goal if it's not needed. You don't need to change the goal if the goal is needed. Achieve and don't
    give up.
    But in most cases, we are often foolish, so we are thrown from side to side, which means we are developing.<br><br>

    When you write algorithms and work with pointers, somethins similar will start to emerge.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
extern char array[1000][]; // pointer 1

int foo(size_t); // pointer 2

int main()
{
  char* const base = &array[0]; // pointer 3
  char* cursor = base; // pointer 4
  void (*method)(void) = foo; // pointer 5
  void (* const cmethod) = foo; // pointer 6
  char** sort = &array[0] // pointer 7

  // code

  return 0;
}

int foo(size_t sz) // counter 1
{
  while(sz--)
  {
    // code

    for (size_t i = 0; i < MACROS; i++) // counter 2 
    { 
      // code 
    } 
    // code 
  } 
  // code 
  return 0; 
} 
</code></pre>
  <p>
    It doesn't matter what's happening in the code, the very structure itself is repulsive. You started writing this
    code,
    you had ideas, thoughts, you were in the flow. A week passed, a bug appeared, and the code is disgusting. You don't
    want
    to debug it, you don't want to see it. Moreover, you're iterating with pointers here, there are many of them,
    they're complex.
    In addition, looking at the algorithms, you don't immediately understand what's going on. Good names often don't
    help
    either because you don't have abstractions yet, you're writing the code for the first time. And creating
    abstractions means
    anticipating all the problems in advance. Furthermore, preparation takes a lot of time. You're alone, and it's
    unlikely that
    anyone else will join you. Therefore, you can't waste time, just write the code.<br><br>

    You probably won't have any architecture for connecting and compiling files either. You'll have a chaotic mess of
    header files
    apprearing, which will be included multiple times. Layers will accumulate, and you can't predict the order in which
    each layer
    apprears. Everything new will be wonderful, and everything old will be hideous. Therefore, you need some kind of
    solution. Chess
    players know that you need to play chess with a plan. It's better to play with a bad plan than with no plan at all.

  <h2>RENAISSANCE</h2>
  <p>
    This library provides you with an OOP-style core for working with pointers and core modifiers that suggest to during
    initialization
    what types of algorithms await you, what definitely exists, and what definitely won't exist. Connecting the core and
    initialization
    provides comprehensive information about the algorithms and also suggests and provides templates for writing these
    algorithms. OOP style
    is architectural self-construction, Just forget about everything! Write code, and let others finish it. If your code
    is still not
    needed by anyone, you'll lose far less time. And if someone does need it, that's someone else's headache. Create
    tasks, lead.<br><br>

    In the following chapters, there will be a comprehensive guide and rich examples on how to use it.
